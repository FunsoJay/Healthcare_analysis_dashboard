## Overview
Using Power BI to visualize patient and hospital data from select U.S. facilities, this project uncovers care trends and delivers insights to improve outcomes, optimize costs, and support data-driven healthcare decisions.

## Files
- **pbix_dashboard_file**: showings the visuals of the analysis.
- **healthcare dataset**
- **README.md**: this provides an overview of the repository and instructions for accessing and using the files in the repo.
## Objectives
1. Identify the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients, and determine which groups have higher admission rates.
2. Find the most frequently diagnosed medical conditions and whether they disproportionately affect specific demographic groups.
3. Analyze how long patients stay in the hospital for various conditions, and whether this differs by hospital or type of admission.
4. Examine average treatment costs by condition and explore cost variations across hospitals and insurance providers.
5. Identify the busiest hospitals and compare them based on patient outcomes such as test results or recovery metrics.
6.	What medications are most often prescribed for each condition? Are they being used consistently across hospitals?
7.	How are patients admitted - mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions - and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?
8.	Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?

## Insights and Findings
1. Over a 6-year period, senior patients (61+) accounted for the highest hospital admissions, with female seniors leading particularly in cases of diabetes and hypertension. This trend highlights the need for targeted healthcare strategies for aging women with chronic conditions.
2. Hospital admissions peaked in July and August of 2020, slightly surpassing other years. The most commonly treated conditions during this period were diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, indicating a continued burden of chronic illnesses.
3. Patients with blood types A+, O+, and O− were admitted most frequently. Hypertensive and arthritic patients had slightly longer hospital stays—by less than a day—though length of stay showed no significant variation across hospitals or admission types.
4. Treatment costs across hospitals showed minimal variation, ranging from $25,077 at NewYork-Presbyterian to $25,729 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Similarly, insurance providers demonstrated consistent cost coverage, indicating fair and comparable treatment expenses across hospitals and insurers.
5. Houston Methodist Hospital consistently recorded the highest number of admissions across all years, indicating its status as the busiest facility in the dataset, followed closely by Johns Hopkins.
6. Hypertensive patients were most frequently prescribed Penicillin and Aspirin, while Lipitor and Ibuprofen were common among diabetic patients. Paracetamol was predominantly used for treating obesity-related cases.
7. Elective admissions, planned in advance, accounted for the majority of hospital entries. While the average length of stay across admission types remained consistent at approximately 16 days, elective cases incurred higher treatment costs compared to emergency and urgent admissions.
8. Medicare covers the majority of patients and ranks as the second-lowest in average treatment cost among all insurance providers.
