## Introduction
What can 55,000+ patient records from 10 top U.S. hospitals reveal about healthcare today?
This interactive Power BI dashboard uncovers powerful insights on admissions, diagnoses, costs, and outcomes — helping stakeholders make smarter, data-driven decisions that improve lives and reduce expenses.

## Objectives
1. Identify the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients, and determine which groups have higher admission rates.
2. Find the most frequently diagnosed medical conditions and whether they disproportionately affect specific demographic groups.
3. Analyze how long patients stay in the hospital for various conditions, and whether this differs by hospital or type of admission.
4. Examine average treatment costs by condition and explore cost variations across hospitals and insurance providers.
5. Identify the busiest hospitals and compare them based on patient outcomes such as test results or recovery metrics.
6.	What medications are most often prescribed for each condition? Are they being used consistently across hospitals?
7.	How are patients admitted - mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions - and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?
8.	Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?

## Insights and Findings
1. Over a 6-year period, senior patients (61+) accounted for the highest hospital admissions, with female seniors leading particularly in cases of diabetes and hypertension. This trend highlights the need for targeted healthcare strategies for aging women with chronic conditions.

2. Hospital admissions peaked in July and August of 2020, slightly surpassing other years. The most commonly treated conditions during this period were diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, indicating a continued burden of chronic illnesses.

3. Patients with blood types A+, O+, and O− were admitted most frequently. Hypertensive and arthritic patients had slightly longer hospital stays—by less than a day—though length of stay showed no significant variation across hospitals or admission types.

4. Treatment costs showed minimal variation across hospitals ($25,077–$25,729) and insurers, indicating fair and consistent expenses.

5. Houston Methodist Hospital consistently recorded the highest number of admissions across all years, indicating its status as the busiest facility in the dataset, followed closely by Johns Hopkins.

6. Elective admissions made up the majority of hospital entries and, despite similar average stays (~16 days), incurred higher treatment costs than emergency or urgent cases.

7. Medicare covers the majority of patients and ranks as the second-lowest in average treatment cost among all insurance providers.
