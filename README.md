# Healthcare_analysis_dashboard
## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing data from select U.S. hospitals and their respective patients using Power BI to uncover patient care trends and deliver actionable insights with the aim of supporting better healthcare decisions, optimize operational costs, and improve patient outcomes.

## Objectives
1. Identify the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients, and determine which groups have higher admission rates.
2. Find the most frequently diagnosed medical conditions and whether they disproportionately affect specific demographic groups.
3. Analyze how long patients stay in the hospital for various conditions, and whether this differs by hospital or type of admission.
4. Examine average treatment costs by condition and explore cost variations across hospitals and insurance providers.
5. Identify the busiest hospitals and compare them based on patient outcomes such as test results or recovery metrics.
6.	What medications are most often prescribed for each condition? Are they being used consistently across hospitals?
7.	How are patients admitted - mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions - and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?
8.	Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates advanced use of Power BI to answer key business questions through impactful visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.
